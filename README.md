# Rocket.Chat Scraper Web Application vibed by Gemini 2.5 Pro 

This application allows users to log into a publicly accessible Rocket.Chat instance, enumerate its channels, and scrape message history from selected channels. The results are compiled into a JSON file for download. This entire project is developed and code generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro following my prompts

**CRUCIAL: This application interacts with live websites and involves web scraping. Understand the following before use:**

1.  **CSS Selectors May Need Adjustment:**
    * The Python code (`scraper_logic.py`) uses CSS selectors to find elements (login fields, channel lists, messages, etc.). These selectors are based on common Rocket.Chat structures but **WILL LIKELY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED** for your specific target Rocket.Chat instance(s). Website structures change frequently. You will need to inspect the HTML of your target site and update the selectors accordingly if the scraper doesn't work as expected.
    * The current selectors are placeholders or examples based on typical Rocket.Chat layouts.

2.  **Anti-Scraping Measures (Cloudflare, etc.):**
    * Websites, especially those behind services like Cloudflare, employ anti-bot measures. While this scraper includes some "politeness" (delays, user-agent), **it may still be blocked, rate-limited, or presented with CAPTCHAs.**
    * Bypassing robust anti-scraping is a complex, ongoing challenge and often requires advanced techniques (e.g., proxy rotation, CAPTCHA solving services) not included here.
    * **Using this tool may lead to your IP address being temporarily or permanently banned by the target service.** Use responsibly.

3.  **Login and Credentials:**
    * You are entering Rocket.Chat credentials into this application. The application uses these credentials to log in programmatically.
    * Ensure the environment where you run this application (especially the Docker container and host) is secure.
    * The application does not store credentials persistently beyond the active scraping session (they are held in memory during a request).

4.  **Ethical and Legal Considerations:**
    * Always respect the terms of service of the website you are scraping.
    * Ensure you have the right to access and scrape the content. Scraping content behind a login has significant ethical and legal implications.
    * This tool is provided for educational and legitimate uses only. The developers are not responsible for misuse.

5.  **Resource Usage:**
    * Scraping, especially "entire history," can be resource-intensive for both your machine (running the headless browser) and the target server. Be mindful of this.
